DaysLeft - AngularJS
========

Sample AngularJS app - using LocalStorage as a storage. Created as an AngularJS exercise.

Basic idea of the app is that you add event with date and app will show you how many days are left till that date. 
You can also add/remove/update event info, filter table etc..

This is also available as:
